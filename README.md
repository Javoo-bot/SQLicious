# SQLicious
🧠 From Philosophy to PostgreSQL 🚀
🌱 Introduction
Inspired by Aristotle's telos (purpose), this repo tracks my path from philosophical inquiry to mastering PostgreSQL. Like Aristotle’s search for order in nature, I now apply SQL to bring structure and clarity to data.

🛤️ The Journey
🧠 Philosophy: Where It Began
Philosophy taught me to ask questions, analyze structures, and find causes. Now, I apply these principles to databases, finding patterns and organizing data.

🗂️ SQLite: The First Step
Starting with SQLite, I learned to handle small datasets, creating order from raw information — my first step in structured data handling.

🚀 PostgreSQL: The Real Challenge
Now onto PostgreSQL, where I’ll unlock the full potential of data. PostgreSQL handles complex, scalable datasets — perfect for mastering the backend developer path.

📂 What’s Inside
📝 PostgreSQL Learning Path: From basics to advanced database features.
💡 SQL Queries: Real examples of queries and optimizations.
🛠️ SQLite Fundamentals: Early steps using SQLite to build a strong foundation.
🌟 Conclusion
This repo reflects my journey from philosophical thought to data mastery. With PostgreSQL as my current focus and SQLite for the basics, I'm building toward backend development, where logic and data meet.
